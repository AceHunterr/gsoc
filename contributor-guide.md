# Contributor guide

ðŸ‘‹ This guide is our main resource for contributors interested in working on Wagtail as part of the Google Summer of Code programme. Please read through it all, top to bottom.

## About Wagtail

<!-- Note for maintainers: matches the "Organization Description" field on https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/wagtail/profile. -->

Wagtail is a popular content management system. It's built on Python and Django, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world. Like Python and Django, the technologies which underpin it, Wagtail is known for its welcoming community.

## GSoC eligibility criteria

We use the same [eligibility criteria](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) as every other GSoC participating organization. In particular

## Contributor tasks

We expect participants to go through a set of initial tasks as they start to get involved with Wagtailâ€™s community, ahead of their application. This is for you to get to know Wagtail as a project and community, and get a sense of how we can work together. It also helps mentors assess the skills of candidates, so we can decide which projects we can take on with you.

No matter which specific project idea youâ€™re interested in, we expect all participants to demonstrate:

- A good **understanding of Google Summer of Code**.
- Awareness of **how open source contributors collaborate**: clear and effective communication, usage of english, online etiquette, code of conduct, communication channels.
- An **interest in learning**: improving in response to feedback, asking questions when appropriate, and helping other contributors.
- Awareness of **git and GitHub and contribution guidelines** to contribute to large code projects.
- Proficiency with **Django, Python, and Wagtail**.

### Improve your chances of being accepted

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of being accepted as a Wagtail GSoC contributor is to start being involved now. Make yourself known to the community. Go through our checklists, recommended tutorials, and help fellow contributors who are going through the same process. Try to contribute to an area related to your proposal. When the time comes to evaluate applications, you will be a known individual.

We're here to help, but we can't watch you every step of the way. We need to see motivation from you. Your activities before the submissions process are the best way to demonstrate this. Any application submitted late, from people we havenâ€™t heard from before, will be considered with a lot of skepticism.

### Checklists

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure youâ€™re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Google Summer of Code

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through. Itâ€™s a good idea to start early, so you can get to know the community and the project.
